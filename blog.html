         What is AI and machine learning? 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data. (Insights, 2020) Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. (What is Artificial Intelligence? How Does AI Work? | Built In, 2020) When it comes to AI, there are a large number of different opinions and definitions as mention above. However, by this mean artificial intelligence (AI) unlike natural intelligent, is a machine capable of performing tasks and solve problems that human considers intelligence. </p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. (What is Machine Learning?, 2020) Therefore, machine learning could be considered as a subset of AI as it helps AI to improve intelligence through learning to predict or decide without the human guideline. However, teaching new abilities for AI can be quite different from humans as AI can only learn through experiences. Nowadays, with a large variaty of AI that has been developed human have separated them into four different categories:</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         •	Reactive Machines 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Is the oldest form of AI and has a limited capability. Which doesn't have the ability to learn from their previous action.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         •	Limited Memory
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Can be understood as the upgrade version of reactive machines as it can store historical data to make decisions. Nowadays, this AI is mainly used by applications that require AI assistant.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         •	Theory of Mind
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;This type of AI is still in development. As the next level of AI, It can learn by analyzing human behavior base on their needs and emotions</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         •	Self-aware
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Is the final stage of AI development, however it still just a hypothesis in science fiction. This AI can replicate human means they can understand emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially desires. </p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;There are a lot of AIs that humans interact with every day, some may be noticed however some may not. Here are some examples of popular AI around the world such as Cortana, Alexa, and Siri. Those AI are popular mainly because they are smartphone assistance, something that we used every day</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Nowadays, humans improve machine accuracy and efficiency by using AI to help improve our daily life by replacing some of the human work and ensure security. Humans have applied AI to a wide range of objects that we use in our daily life like websites, applications, the internet, and smartphone, or even medical facilities. Firstly, AI used in smart devices can learn our voice tone and face texture for face and voice recognition features to create autonomous vehicles or smart home control by voice. We use those features to improve security through face scans and smart homes. Secondly, we deployed AI on Internet for cybersecurity such as block spam emails, detect fraud in social accounts, or input missing code lines. Thirdly, AI is also capable of detect dangerous internal organs disease after scanning a large number of organ pictures that they have taken before. AI still faces a lot of opposition, as people found incorrect information from science fiction movies. However, they don't know that their lives today have been dependent on AI</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Potential impact from this technology: 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;With the rapid growth of technology, it is sure that soon AI would exist in every aspect of our life. This technology would not only be used for functions mention above but would also be involved in many ways. Our education system can be changed entirely different, due to AI assistants helping the teacher to recognize student's status through face recognition for a better education plan. Moreover, the rapid growth of the AI industry can also erase some professions in the future such as public transport drivers when autonomous vehicles are widely used. Fully functional robots that are built base on AI can reduce a great amount of work for humans so that we can focus on intellectual work and entertainment. AI will also eliminate a large number of career paths that concerned as easy task for them in the future such as bus drivers, receptionists, market search analysts, and security guards. AI eventually will change significantly how our world work.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         AI and machine learning affect on our daily life: 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;With the constant development of AI and machine learning technology, I can save a fair amount of time in deciding things as AI can remember the user preferences and use them to recommend. AI technology definitely not only affect me but also my parents and elders due to the help of IoT that blends with AI. Now we can easily monitor many household appliances using voice command which helps reduces elderly care work.</p>

         Cloud computing
       </h1>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         What is Cloud computing? 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). (What is Cloud Computing, 2020) By using cloud technology, companies and developers can both save time and money for owning facilities and maintenance for hardware and software. Cloud computing also provides a better service as users can easily data back up and disaster recovery if the event data loss does occur.  There are three main providers in the market which is AWS, Azure, and  Google Cloud. </p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;AWS: own by AWS Inc. launch in 2006 provides in 25 geographical regions and 78 Availability Zones</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Azure: own by Microsoft launch in 2010 provides in 54 geographical regions and 140 Availability Zones</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Google cloud: own by Google launch in 2008 provides in 21 geographical regions and 61 Availability Zones. (Chand, 2020)</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Types of cloud services:
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS): The most basic category of cloud computing types, IaaS lets you rent IT infrastructure - servers and virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems - from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): that gives developers the tools to build and host web applications. PaaS is designed to give users access to the components they require to quickly develop and operate web or mobile applications over the Internet, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, networks, and databases.</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): which is used for web-based applications. SaaS is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet where cloud providers host and manage the software applications making it easier to have the same application on all of your devices at once by accessing it in the cloud. (News, 2020)</p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;The development of Cloud technology would not only affect the way that we work but also the way we live. Cloud technology affects every aspect of our world such as social media, education, and development. Facebook could be the clearest example of social media. With cloud technology, we able to connect with others with just a single button. Each individual can also become a reporter as users can easily upload their emotions, latest events, and news with cloud base application. With the complicated situation of the epidemic caused by COVID, Cloud computing provides a secure and remote way for users to avoid the effect of COVID. This helps companies and students to keep productivity at work safely from Covid but still acquire high-security measures. </p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Potential impact from this technology: 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;In today’s environment, a considerable amount of time and resources are invested in building applications and systems that either scale or failover. Consequently, serverless architecture has been designed to give developers a quick way to create systems and applications.
         The platform dynamically determines how much infrastructure is needed and then automatically provisions the infrastructure to support the system or application. Continuous innovations in cloud computing are set to push artificial intelligence and the IoT to the fore in the next decade and beyond. These innovations will support emerging technologies and help them adapt to different platforms and devices such as mobile and home appliances. For instance, today’s mobile devices require a lot of time and processing power to analyse unstructured data. These devices, therefore, have to send the data to servers in the cloud slowing down the response time of AI. As a result, industry experts predict that mobile devices will use inference continuously in the future. Inference is where AI learns in the cloud and applies the knowledge gained to real-life problems. This will allow the device to categorise photos according to content, respond to voice commands immediately and set cameras to capture subjects under different shooting conditions.(Team, 2020)
         </p>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;In the future, humans would likely depend on cloud technology as it would spread in every aspect of our life. Cloud computing is increasingly gaining ground with the continuous improvement of 5g technology as it allows individuals in the technology 4.0 industry to simply connect, work, and learn. Companies and students may all use cloud service for a safer connection and reduce the maintenance of hardware and software costs. Therefore jobs involved in hardware maintenance agencies may reduce in the future. Cloud technology is also a great place to create AIs due to the abundance of processing power and service that the cloud provides. The response time of AI used in mobile devices will reduce when connecting the AI with the cloud. This way, AI can be faced with millions of real-life problems provided by the cloud for self-improvement </p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Cloud computing affect on our daily life: 
       </h1>
       <p class="black">&emsp;&emsp;Cloud computing plays a key role in having a significant influence on students, especially IT students. The cloud system not only impacts academic success for the students but also their career opportunities. Cloud technology has been introduced in many higher education classes with tools such as canvas, GitHub, and Google Drive is crucial to their learning processes because of the essence of practice adapting to modern technology. The cloud will undoubtedly indirectly transform our everyday life as the cloud offers developers, companies, and enterprises with a safer platform to simply manage their company. As it grows in every corner of human technology, people around you can increasingly be taken into the cloud: social media, mobile devices, etc all help people minimize the pressure of their everyday lives.</p>
