      <h1 class=super_big_text>Project Ideas</h1>
      <h1 class="big_text">
         Overview
       </h1>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;The project idea is to create a healthy tracker app that allows users to easily create meals for the family base on nutrition value and preferences. This application will be build base on AI and cloud computing technology to ensure the quality of application support and reduce the cost of building the application. With this project, users can save time, effort in planning meals for their families. They can easily plan and calculate the number of ingredients that need to buy with a single touch.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Motivation
       </h1>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;According to data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the obesity rate reached 42.4% in 2017-2018 â€“ surpassing 40% for the first time. Although the increase was not significant between 2015-2016 and 2017-2018, the new data represents a failure to meet the federal government's public health goals set for this year. (Galvin,2020) The statistics show that there are a significant number of obesity cases and that the rate is increasing rapidly. With this project development, obese people and others can improve and take care of the physical and medical condition of themself and their relatives. This application can be crucial for people who are in need to improve their lifestyle. </p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Description 
       </h1>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;The goal of this project is to develop a mobile app that will enable you to conveniently select nutritious dishes for your family. Using the application can help you calculate nutritional ingredients in food by weight in just seconds. By choosing family size, gender, age, and country, the app will show you the proportion of ingredients that you need to buy to balance the nutrition and ensure the goal that you have select for your family. By using this application, user can improve the variety of dishes and your cooking skill with the help of AI technology, dishes that you have previously made will be store in your preferences list for it to recommend based on your previous selections. Besides choosing recipes from the AI recommendation system, you can also select recipes that are shared online in the community. Additional features will be added for future progress,e.g, weight tracker, home workout plan, and water reminder.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Tools and Technologies 
       </h1>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;There are some tools and technologies that play a core role in realizing this project. This application must make sure the ability to keep a large amount of food recipe and have an AI that can recommended exactly to the user's preferences. As for the requirement that I have mentioned above here are some examples of tools and technologies that can be kept in mind when developing this project.</p>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere. Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy compelling apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value. (Apex, 2020) To create a cloud-native application that can easily store data and preferences of customers we also need the help of SQL. And by the database that we have built using SQL, we can use Azure office to create machine learning that drawn-out information from the database for recommendations</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Skills required
       </h1>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;	With this project, the most essential skill would be coding as the backbone of the app will be made by a coder who would also require the skill in using SQL or any similar database creator.</p>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;	The user interface can consider as the most important feature as it the first thing that users in contact with. Therefore, it is crucial to be skillful in the user's interface. </p>
       <p class="black"> &emsp;&emsp;	Thirdly, have the skill to create a basic AI that has machine learning to remember user preferences can come in handy for further updates in the future.</p>
       <h1 class="big_text">
         Outcome
       </h1>
       <p class="black">If we could make this project become reality and with the help of ideological work from the government then diabetes, obesity, and death rate in many countries can decrease. In addition, people will think less about their health condition with the help of this project and also save a decent amount of medical assistant However, this application might not be able to come in hand with undeveloped countries as they don't give much attention to health care.</p>
